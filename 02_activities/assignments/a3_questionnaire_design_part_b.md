# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?



The quality of the sample is crucial for ensuring that the survey results accurately reflect the opinions and preferences of the target population, which is eligible voters in Canada. Using Simple Random Sampling (SRS) as the primary strategy ensures that every individual in the target population has an equal chance of being selected. This helps reduce bias and makes it likely that the sample will reflect the diverse opinions of all eligible voters.

However, while SRS is effective in achieving randomness and reducing selection bias, it might not capture specific subgroups with unique characteristics or concerns as effectively as Stratified Sampling. Without stratification, there is a risk that some important subgroups, such as voters from different regions or demographic backgrounds, might be underrepresented.

Given the use of SRS alone, I expect the sample to be reasonably representative of the target population. However, there may still be some limitations in fully representing all subgroups within the population, which could be better addressed with stratified sampling.



2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.


Yes, based on the class content covering error, survey quality, and ethics, I would like to make changes to improve the quality and ethical standards of the survey. Kindly check this link to view my changes:  https://github.com/Mzaydan/survey-revision/blob/main/UPDATED%20SURVEY 



3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?


The purpose of the survey is to understand voter preferences and opinions to inform campaign strategies. This goal requires directly asking voters about their intentions, concerns, and satisfaction levels, which is best achieved through a survey.

While an observational study can provide insights into voter behavior and trends (e.g., tracking social media posts, analyzing voting patterns from previous elections), it lacks the direct feedback that a survey provides. Observational studies do not capture the specific reasons behind voter choices or their opinions on key issues, which are crucial for developing targeted campaign strategies.

Therefore, an observational study alone would not fully fulfill the survey's purpose. It might complement the survey by providing additional context and trends, but direct survey questions are necessary to gather the specific information needed to understand voter preferences and improve campaign efforts.

## Why am I doing this assignment?

This assignment supports learning outcomes 1, 2, 3, and 4:
	1.	Develop ability to implement simple probability samples.
	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric

-	All required components are present and complete **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Assessment of representativeness is justified based on class content **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Changes to original survey are justified based on class content and best practices for sampling **Complete / Incomplete**
