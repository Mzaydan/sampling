# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part A)

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.


# Your Changes

The number of your chosen topic: `#2`

Describe the purpose of your survey:

The purpose of this survey is to understand what voters want from my political party and its leader to maintain a lead and eventually win the upcoming federal election.

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:

Target Population: Eligible voters in Canada.
Sampling Frame: The list of registered voters provided by Elections Canada.
Sampling Units: Individual registered voters.
Overall Sampling Strategy: Simple random sampling to ensure a representative sample of the voting population.




How SRS Ensures a Representative Sample:

Simple Random Sampling (SRS) makes sure everyone in the target population has an equal chance of being chosen. This randomness helps avoid bias, ensuring no group is over- or under-represented. SRS helps the sample reflect the diversity of the whole voter population in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, and location. This is important for accurately capturing the opinions and preferences of all voters.

Potential Limitations and Considerations:

While SRS is good for getting a representative sample, it might not always cover specific subgroups that are important for the survey. For example, if different regions or demographic groups have unique voting behaviors, SRS might miss these details. To solve this, we can use stratified sampling.

Alternative Sampling Strategy: Stratified Sampling

In stratified sampling, we divide the population into subgroups based on characteristics like region, age, or political affiliation. Then, we take a random sample from each subgroup. This way, all important subgroups are well-represented in the sample.

Rationale for Stratified Sampling:

Stratified sampling gives more detailed insights by ensuring each subgroup's unique preferences and concerns are captured. For instance, urban and rural voters might have different priorities. By stratifying the sample based on region and then sampling randomly within each subgroup, the survey can better reflect the diverse opinions of different population segments. This helps create more targeted and effective campaign strategies.
